Description

Jet-pack it's a game where the player drive a small panda with is jet-pack, the goal it's to do the more score you can, they will be some coin's falling from the sky and a lot of other object, diamant, coin's, petrol (to full up you jet pack until out of gas), bubble's to protect you of any danger's for a period of 5 seconde, but for sure you have to be carefull, all bombes are coming from every where, you touch it you died, you don't fill up your jet pack on time you died, so now at your keyboard and try to do your best record!

MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- the jet pack can move from up, left, right, can jump, and subject to gravity
- bombe's coming randomly from the right and left side horizontaly
- coin's to recolt coming verticaly from the top of the screen
- doing all the collition possible, with added point when coin's are touching and died when bombe are touchin

BONUS ADDED

- diamant falling form the sky with different score point's than coin's
- petrol icon falling form the sky to full up your lifetime
- bubbles to protect you from any bombe for a 5 seconds period
- added a nivel 2 when reach 20 point, after that their is more bombes coming form every sides and the game start to be really hard
